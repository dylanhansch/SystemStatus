SystemStatus
============

I am no longer maintaining this, and it no longer reflects my current abilities or style. As such, I have archived this repo.

System Status is an extensive system and network monitoring tool. This includes a bunch of improvements I made on-top of [mojeda's ServerStatus](https://github.com/mojeda/ServerStatus).

============

1. Download the latest stable release from https://github.com/dylanhansch/SystemStatus/releases/latest and upload the files do the desired directory on your website. (Example: /status/)
2. Edit the config.php accordingly.
3. Navigate to your SystemStatus installation through a web browser and follow the installation instructions. (http://example.com/status/install.php)
4. Place "remote.php" on each server you want to monitor in a place that's accessible to the web.
5. Log into the admin account (username:admin & password:default123456)
6. Add all the servers you want to monitor and you're done!
